    "answer": "Based on the provided text, the best time to apply fertilizers depends on several factors, including the type of fertilizer and the crop's growth stage:\n\n**For Nitrogen (N):**\n\n* **Top dressing:** Apply nitrogen in split doses.  The provided texts suggest applying it at 15 and 30 days after transplanting or direct sowing.  For direct sown crops, apply it in bands.  Irrigate after application.\n* **Basal application:**  A portion of nitrogen can be applied at sowing (along with P2O5 and K2O) according to moisture availability.  In areas with good rainfall, 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% split between 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing. In areas with uncertain rainfall, 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% at around 35 days after sowing.\n\n**For Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K):**\n\n* **Basal application:** Apply the entire recommended amount of P2O5 and K2O at sowing.\n\n**For Biofertilizers (e.g., Phosphobacteria):**\n\n* **Before planting:** Apply biofertilizers just before planting and irrigate immediately afterward.  Do not mix with chemical fertilizers.  Applying them at 30, 60, and 90 days after planting as an alternative is mentioned, with copious irrigation following each application.\n\n\nRemember to reduce the recommended nitrogen by 25% if using biofertilizers to see their full benefit.  The specific timing should also be adjusted to suit your local conditions and crop requirements.\n"
  },
  {
    "query": "when to use fertilizers?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided text, fertilizers, specifically micronutrient fertilizers, should be used when a deficiency of a particular micronutrient is identified in the soil or in the plants themselves.  This deficiency can lead to an excess accumulation of other nutrients, negatively impacting crop yields.  The response of crops to micronutrient application confirms the need for their use.  However, care must be taken to avoid toxicity by ensuring even distribution of the fertilizer.  The text also mentions fertigation as a method to improve fertilizer use efficiency, implying that fertilizers are applied during the growing season, along with irrigation water.  Soil testing is a key component in determining the need for fertilizer application.\n"

These are breeding grounds for pests.\n* **Control moisture:** Excess moisture attracts insects. Address any leaks or damp areas.\n\n**2. Physical Control:**\n\n* **Dermestid beetles:** Regularly check mounted animals and animal hides. Vacuum hides or freeze them for several days to kill pests.\n* **Stored product pests:**  Exclusion (preventing entry) and elimination (removing infested items) are crucial. Sanitation plays a large role.\n\n**3. Pesticide Use (only as a last resort):**\n\n* **Stored product pests (like carpet beetles):** If sanitation and exclusion fail, apply a dust to void spaces or use spot treatments under rugs, along baseboards, and around cracks and crevices.\n* **Other pests:**  Dusts can be applied to cracks and crevices, crawl spaces, and wall voids (in inaccessible areas). Diatomaceous earth can desiccate pests in dried-out areas.  Boric acid baits can be effective but should be used cautiously.  Broadcast sprays should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and in high-profile areas where other methods have failed.\n\n\n**In summary:**  The best way to remove pests is to prevent them in the first place through good sanitation and by eliminating food sources and nesting areas.  Pesticides should only be used as a last resort and according to label instructions.\n"
